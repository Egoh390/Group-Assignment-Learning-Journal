# Group-Assignment-Learning-Journal
### Project 1 - Feedback
This part of the assignment was quite simple and I managed to connect with my group without too much issue. The review of the sample apps allowed me to see some good designs and ideas that we could implement into our app and I also wrote my reviews down which could potentially help in the future of the assignment. It took us about 1 hour of in-person meetings and took me about 3 to 4 hours of personal work to complete my part of the project. Seeing sample apps made me feel like I could tell the difference between a good and bad design as well as how to make for a good user experience and interface. There was nothing that I thought I could study more apart from the readings on empathize and define.
### Project 2 - Feedback
This part of the assignment was relatively straightforward and had a lot more to do with discussion with my group. Through that, I got to know the thought process of my group mates better and I feel it helped to improve team dynamics. It took about 3 hours of group discussion in total to finish the document while the exploring of Google Appsheet took 2 and a half hours as Patrik and I wanted to explore the features and undertand it as best as we could. We split up initially into 2 groups to look into Appsheet and Powerapps but also discusssed and decided to individually look at the other app to get a better understanding of both so we could decide which platform to choose. There were lines of code or fomulas found in the sample apps of both Powerapps and Appsheet that were confusing but I found the UI and graphical editing of Powerapps to be familiar having worked with something similar before. I could not really figure out what those formula/code was for so I could look into it to understand it better. It also reminded me of UX and UI concepts I've studied before and I'm confident I should be able to make something user-friendly.
### Project 3 - Feedback
This part of the project was also quite straightforward and we managed to finish it quickly and within 2 meetings. We got to play around with powerapps more while trying to make the test prototype and also found some parts to cut from out original idea due to how complex it would be to make the app later on. I have some concerns that the final project may be rushed due to us only having 2 weeks from the date of submission for project 3. We feel like powerapps was a good choice due to it feeling very intuitive and simple to get into, despite not allowing us to work collaboratively on the project, which hopefully may not be too big of an issue.
