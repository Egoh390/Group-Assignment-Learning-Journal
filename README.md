# Group-Assignment-Learning-Journal
This part of the assignment was quite simple and I managed to connect with my group without too much issue. The review of the sample apps allowed me to see some good designs and ideas that we could implement into our app and I also wrote my reviews down which could potentially help in the future of the assignment. It took us about 1 hour of in person meetings and took me about 3 to 4 hours of personal work to complete my part of the project. Seeing sample apps made me feel like I could tell the difference between a good and bad design as well as how to make for a good user experience and interface. There was nothing that I thought I could study more apart from the readings on empathize and define.
